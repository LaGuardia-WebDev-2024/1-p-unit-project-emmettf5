    <p> <em>Jazz Music</em> was a rebelious sound back then. <strong><em> Everybody </em></strong> was used to hearing the Bach and mozart inspired classical peices.<br>
    People heard it as something different, with a swing to the drums and the bass walking around. <br>
    It was a unique sound no one had heard of. This evolved to the jazz wave, where it was seen as sleek and cool, but hard to comprehend. <br>
    This led to people falling in love with the sound as it kept evolving through each generation,<strong> it led to hip hop, funk, rock, blues and everything has jazz influence hidden deep.</strong> 





    <h4><br> This live music relys on the listening of musicains and everybody magically hearing ideas out of an instrument. <br></h4>
